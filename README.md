GameLauncher
============
A Windows tray application to launch games, quickly

Game Launcher is a simple application that lives in your notification area/system tray. 
It maintains a list of games you choose to have on it, and allows you to launch those games
from anywhere by right-clicking the icon, or pressing Windows+G on your keyboard. 
It even includes a dock!

NOTE:
-----
This is the public git repo for Game Launcher. If you don't know what this is and you're
looking for the latest version, just head over to SourceForge to download the latest stable
installer: https://sourceforge.net/projects/game-launcher/

I'm quite new to git (and version control systems in general), so any pull requests etc. can
take time while I get comfortable working with git.

For general info and help with the application please visit its website:
